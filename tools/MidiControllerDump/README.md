MidiControllerDump
==================

This is a quick simple Windows-only app that displays info about MIDI devices in the system. It can be used to provide info about MIDI-based DJ controllers - what's their response for MMC device query and any messages sent when the user presses the buttons, moves the sliders and wheels.

The information is provided in a simple notepad-like window from which the user can copy-paste.

The main point of this app is to be as small as possible, with no external dependencies, so a single EXE file can be sent to users for scanning their controllers.
