# SkauTan
Music player for Skautské Tancování

This is a special music player that simplifies the playlist creation for ballroom dancing events. It allows one to
quickly create a playlist consisting of semi-random choice of songs, based on the dance genre, using templates. Using
LRU- and rating-weighted random choice, SkauTan makes sure that no song is over-played over the sessions, while still
playing favorite songs more often.


NOTE: The software is currently being developed, it doesn't yet have all the features advertised!
